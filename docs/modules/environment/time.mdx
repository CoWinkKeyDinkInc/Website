### Time

#### Time Set

Sets the map to use a certain time on match load, measured in ticks.

```xml
<world>
    <!-- Sets map to midnight -->
    <timeset>18000</timeset>
</world>
```

#### Random Time

World time can be set from one of six possible times at random when a match loads.

```xml
<world>
    <randomtime/>
    <!-- 1000, 6000, 12610, 13000, 14000, 18000 -->
    <!-- day   noon  dusk   night         midnight -->
</world>
```

#### Time Lock

Locks the time to a certain time, either from `<timeset>` or from the world data.
Time lock must be specifically turned off if one wishes to have the time cycle
when using `<timeset>` or `<randomtime/>`.
This can also be accomplished with the `doDaylightCycle` [gamerule](/docs/modules/mechanics/gamerules).

```xml
<world>
    <timelock>on</timelock>  <!-- Defaults to off -->
</world>
```

### Dimension

Change the dimension the map is played in to `nether`, `normal` or `the end`. The default is `normal`.
This mainly affects the color of the sky and natural mob spawning if it's enabled.

```xml
<dimension>nether</dimension>
```

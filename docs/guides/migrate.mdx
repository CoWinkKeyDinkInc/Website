title: Help Us Migrate Past Files!
---

We need help migrating the old documentation files to this website. These were written in HAML, and need to be converted to Markdown and HTML/JSX (the technologies that the new documentation website uses). In order to do so, please continue reading this guide.

First, select a documentation file from `reference`, `guides` or `modules`, all located within the `src` folder in the old [XML Documentation repository](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/docs.oc.tc), and convert it to HTML/ERB using [this tool](https://haml2erb.org).

Once you've got an HTML file, remove all unnecessary HTML. You will notice what's necessary or what's not if you take a look at existing migrated documents [here](https://github.com/Electroid/PGM/blob/gh-pages/docs), but generally you should maintain only maintain HTML tables, with a few exceptions:

- Replace `<%= html_escape([XML Tags] %>` with ```{`[XML TAGS]`}```. Since Docusaurus 2 supports MDX, this is the only way to escape XML from rendering inside an HTML table.
- Replace `<span class="highlight">` and possible child `<code>` elements with `<label>`, from this:

```html
<td>
  <span class="highlight">
    <code> {`<world-borders> </world-borders>`} </code>
  </span>
</td>
```

to this:

```html
<td>
  <label> {`<world-borders> </world-borders>`} </label>
</td>
```

That's because `<code>` tags end up rendering multiline code blocks, not a one line code block.

Last but not least, add a header that specifies an ID for that document and a title, like so:

```
---
id: regions
title: Defining Regions
---
```

### Indentation

##### Map Indentation

Modules must all start on column one. This means that all children tags under the `<map>` tag must be aligned with said `<map>` tag.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map proto="1.4.0">
<name>Blocks DTC</name>
<version>1.3.4</version>
<objective>Leak lava from the enemy's obsidian core.</objective>
</map>
```

##### Child Element Indentation

Modules that have sub elements such as the `author` tag must be indented with 4 spaces below the parent element.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map proto=”1.4.0">
<authors>
    <author uuid="060baa18-2852-40d8-afcb-e61607c04be3"/> <!-- PepsiDog -->
</authors>
</map>
```

##### Space Between Modules

There should be no white spaces between modules. That means the end of one module should have the start of another on the immediate next line.

```xml
<!-- Correct -->
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map proto="1.4.0">
<name>Blocks DTC</name>
<version>1.3.4</version>
<objective>Leak lava from the enemy's obsidian core.</objective>
</map>
```

```xml
<!-- Incorrect! -->
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<map proto="1.4.0">

<name>Blocks DTC</name>

<version>1.3.4</version>

<objective>Leak lava from the enemy's obsidian core.</objective>

</map>
```

##### Closing tags

The ending tag of one module should be on the line directly above the beginning tag of a following module.

##### Line Ending

XML files must end with an empty line. For example, if the ending `</map>` tag is on line 52, the last line of the XML file would be line 53.

### Layout

##### Main Map Definitions

There are 6 modules that make up the maps definition. They should all be placed at the top of the document; following the order below: `map`, `name`, `version`, `objective`, `authors` and `contributors`.

`NOTE:` Contributors are optional but are still to remain at the top.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map proto="1.4.0">
<name>Blocks DTC</name>
<version>1.3.4</version>
<objective>Leak lava from the enemy's obsidian core.</objective>
<authors>
    <author uuid="260004f0-996b-4539-ba21-df4ee6336b63"/> <!-- Elliott_ -->
</authors>
<contributors>
    <contributor contribution="A contribution">aHelper</contributor>
</contributors>
</map>
```

##### The Protocol

All maps being added to the repository should use the most up to date protocol.

##### Authors and Contributors

An author using a uuid definition should have an inline comment to denote the players IGN.

```xml
<authors>
    <author uuid="260004f0-996b-4539-ba21-df4ee6336b63"/> <!-- Elliott_ -->
</authors>
```

##### Filters and Regions

The filter definition should be defined before the definition of regions.

### Naming Conventions

##### Map Names Map

Names should not contain any special characters or symbols. This includes unicode and letters with accents.

##### Versioning

Follow the Semantic Versioning Schema For example: `1.2.3`

A Major is classified by the addition of major gameplay changes - changes that could be called a new map. A Minor is classified by the addition of changes that affect gameplay but not to the extent of a major. A Patch is classified by a small change to fix a bug or unintentional feature. `NOTE:` Bump this patch when you fix something on a map.

##### Objectives

Objectives should be short and tell the player what they have to do to win the match.

```xml
<objective>Win the match by killing the enemy team!</objective>
```

##### Identification Naming

Modules that require an `id` to be defined should be named in all lowercase and use a `-` dash to signify a space.

```xml
<team id="only-blue">blue</team>
```

##### Enumeration Naming

Names which are defined as enumeration in bukkit should be transferred into lower case and `_` underscores replaced with spaces. `PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL` should become `protection environmental`.

##### Material Definition

In places where you define a material type use the bukkit name following the Enumeration Naming (3.5) instead of the ID. This makes it a lot easier to know what block is being defined during debugging processes.

##### Team Filters

Team filters should be named by following the Identification naming (3.4) and start with `only-` followed by the team name.

`only-blue` `only-elves`

Each team file constitutes a team that can be loaded with the `/tm register <team>` command.

The process of creating team files is pretty straight forward. You simply create a `YML` file under the `/plugins/Events/teams` folder with a name and a list of player UUIDs.

_Example_

```yml
name: A
players:
  - 30401f63-f5bb-4f24-9a5a-0ecd5f706115
  - 2318a6ef-937d-41ad-aac0-59070815de92
  - 77d845ce-c88a-467d-9880-1db671a18933
  - 9b4fbb38-ed55-44ad-b510-9f0197433f93
  - 02407912-8bbf-4b7b-a34c-a45339841436
```
